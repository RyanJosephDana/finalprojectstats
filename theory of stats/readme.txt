Hello!
This is my final project code for Theory of Statistics I 

Analysis.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that does all of the python programming, here you will find the EDA, Linear Model Building Linear Model Analysis and Bayesian Analysis

R_code.r is borrowed/changed code originating from https://github.com/jgabry/bayes_R2, the author of the paper where I built a bayesian model in a similar style to the paper

Housing.csv is the original untapped data given for the project

housing_cleaned_dataset.csv is the changed/picked data after ETL/Data Cleaning

file.txt is the output from the R code that gives all of the posterior analysis that then goes into Analysis.ipynb for further processing
